# DataScience Prompt Engineer

This repository contains a fine-tuned language model tailored for prompt engineering in data science applications. It demonstrates the complete workflow from data preparation, model training, to saving and deploying a customized model using Hugging Face's transformers and datasets libraries.

## Features

- Custom dataset preparation and tokenization specifically designed for data science-related prompts and responses.
- Model training with detailed tracking of training loss across multiple steps to ensure performance monitoring.
- Integration with Hugging Face Hub for seamless model pushing and sharing.
- Utilizes state-of-the-art transformer architectures adapted for instruction tuning or prompt engineering.
- Practical example code illustrating how to fine-tune language models on specialized instruction datasets.

## Contents

- Preprocessing scripts to tokenize and format datasets for training.
- Training loop with loss tracking per step for performance evaluation.
- Scripts to save and push the trained model and tokenizer to the Hugging Face Model Hub.
- Example usage instructions to replicate or extend the fine-tuning process.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and install required dependencies.
2. Prepare your dataset or use the included instruction tuning dataset.
3. Run the training notebook or script to fine-tune the model.
4. Save and push the model to the Hugging Face Hub for easy access.
5. Use the fine-tuned model for generating or enhancing data science prompts.

## Model Hub

The fine-tuned model is available at: `ZyrexAN/DataScience-PromptEngineer` on Hugging Face, ready for use or further fine-tuning.
